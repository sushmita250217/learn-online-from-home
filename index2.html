                <h1> java tutorial</h1>
                <p>java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in
                    1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of
                    UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference will take you through
                    simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.</p>
                <h2>why to learn java</h2>
                <p>Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially
                    when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of
                    learning Java Programming:

                    Object Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on
                    the Object model.

                    Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is
                    compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte
                    code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on
                    whichever platform it is being run on.

                    Simple − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it
                    would be easy to master.

                    Secure − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems.
                    Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

                    Architecture-neutral − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which
                    makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.

                    Portable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the
                    specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability
                    boundary, which is a POSIX subset.

                    Robust − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile
                    time error checking and runtime checking.</p>
